# Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews

##Problem Statement:

  Make a small Python Flask application which makes use of reviews.json and relation.json to show two things :

    1. Overall sentiments of reviews for Sterling Resorts. You can make a pie chart or bar graph for
        the three sentiments (Positive, Negative, and Neutral).
    2. A page each for each of the three child hotels. On this hotel page, one should be able to see
        the sentiment graph (similar to the overall graph above) as well as all reviews of that hotel.
  *On running your application, we must first see the pie chart / bar graph for the overall sentiments of
    the 900 or so reviews.
  *On clicking on one of the three buttons for hotels, we must be routed to a page where we see the sentiment graph for
    that hotel, followed by reviews for that hotel.
  *If you do not wish to make multiple pages, you may combine task 1 and 2 in one single page itself. Make
    sure every section has its appropriate title.
